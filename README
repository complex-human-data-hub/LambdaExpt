STARTING THE LOCAL SERVER
=========================
# To develop run flask server locally
FLASK_APP=experiment.py flask run


ACCESSING YOUR EXPERIMENT
=========================
If you are developing locally the change to a localhost address, for example:
http://localhost:5000/unique-expt

or in production:
https://000028.mall-lab.com/unique-expt


ADDING PARAMETERS TO PASS TO PYTHON
===================================
You can also add parameters to pass to the get_data(opts) function mentioned below:
http://localhost:5000/expt?unique-expt?foo=bar&foo2=bar2
or
https://000028.mall-lab.com/unique-expt?foo=bar&foo2=bar2


BASIC STRUCTURE OF YOUR EXPERIMENT
==================================
* expt_config.py
This is where your python code goes. You will setup your experimental stimuli in this file. You must provide the following variables and functions in this file:

VARIABLES:
  expt_uid
  s3_static_bucket
  s3_data_bucket
  s3_results_key
  DEBUG

You can optionally provide a flask Blueprint using the 'custom_code' variable. Flask Blueprints allow you to define your own routes. 

FUNCTIONS:
  get_data(opts)
    foo = opts.get('foo')
    return object_to_pass_to_javascript

* templates/exp.html
This is were you will create your experiments HTML

* static_b912979ee2b5aceb28c429466f9dedd8
  This is a directory for you static files: images, css, js


RESEARCHER PAGE
===============
https://researcher.mall-lab.com/expt?uid=b912979ee2b5aceb28c429466f9dedd8

From the researcher page you can get your results and create custom links for participants

If you are on a linux machine the easiest way to get to the researcher page associated with your experiment is to run:
./goto-researcher-page.sh

CREATING CUSTOM URL TO PARTICIPANTS
============================
# To create a new participant in the database, go to the researcher page, enter the participants email address, and you the system will generate a URL to give to the participant, for example:
https://000028.mall-lab.com/expt?uid=bd307e938632af6df0d1dfa769d85ae2
