    Thank you for participating in a project investigating the cognitive processes involved in recognition memory and source memory. Recognition memory is a type of memory that involves determining whether a particular item has been previously encountered. Source memory is a type of memory that involves making judgments about the context in which an item was initially encountered. Context can refer to things such as the location on a computer screen or the colour of the font in which words were presented. Although there exists many 'mechanistic' models that aim to explain the underlying cognitive processes in recognition memory (e.g., Dennis &amp; Humphreys, 2001; Osth &amp; Dennis, 2015, Shiffrin &amp; Steyvers, 1997), there are virtually no such models for source memory. The aim of the present research is conduct a series of empirical investigations that will each contribute to the development of a mechanistic model of source memory. Experiments will involve a variety of memory paradigms (e.g., recognition tasks, source memory tasks, the signal-to-respond paradigm, list discrimination, and associative recognition), each investigating a variety of performance phenomena (e.g., the list length effect, list strength effect, word frequency effect, context-dependent memory, and effects of retrieval expectations). A comprehensive understanding of the processes underlying source memory is important to develop, as source memory has been shown to be severely affected by the process of aging relative to other types of memory (Benjamin, 2010). The resulting model of this research will consequently have large implications for the way we understand the mechanisms underlying the storage and retrieval of source information.

    In this experiment you completed one to several cycles of a computer-based memory task. In each of the tasks, you were presented with new words/items. The words/items could have been presented in different contexts (e.g., the location of the words on the screen; the font colour). You were required to remember each word and in some conditions its context, while some also required to rate each on a scale of pleasantness. For words, half of the words presented were words that occur frequently in print and the other half were words that are encountered relatively rarely. The purpose of the 'pleasantness' ratings during study were simply to keep participants focussed on the task. You were then presented with a simple card game that acted as an interference task, with the aim of negating the effect of short term memory during the retention interval. At test you were presented with a selection of the original words/items (and some lure words/items) in the centre of the screen. You were required to identify whether you had seen each word/item previously, or whether it was a lure. In some cases, you were also required to identify the source/context in which some of the words/items were previously presented to you. In the experiment, accuracy in matching each word/item to its source was compared between cycles of the task where different manipulations were used (e.g., different list lengths, list strengths, source manipulations, retrieval expectations, response lags etc...).
